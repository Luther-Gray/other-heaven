  <p>A few years ago, I got added to a game jam (that we couldn't finish in time. :] ) and someone brought up the idea of an evolving weapon. I drafted up a few sets. Since the project was scrapped, a lot of GDD work and art was thrown into the trash and it wasn't until just now that I thought about dragging this stuff up from my hard drive.</p>

<p>I might use some of them in projects later, probably after adapting them to 3D, but they were fun to sprite out as well~</p>
<p>And if you couldn't tell, yes it was VERY fun making that fan blade.</p>
