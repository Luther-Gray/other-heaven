  <h1 class="title">Medic Mod</h1>
  <p class="subtitle"><strong>2025-04-10</strong></p>

  <p>I play a lot of Minecraft, especially modded. I've always wanted to make my own pack on the Fabric modloader, but I didn't have all the mods I needed to make it happen.</p>
<p>After months of oo-ing and aa-ing over the right version for me, I settled on 1.21 and went to work on my very first mod.</p>
<p>Java was hell and Gradle should burn in a pit far away from mortal eyes.</p>
<p><a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/medic!/gallery">Medic! on Modrinth</a></p>
<p>I've made a few mods since then, Tools of the Apoc and something else I have cooking up that I'm bug fixing now, but Roblox Development has distracted me a lot lol.</p>
<p>Also the icon for Medic! was my first time speed sculpting in Blockbench. I did it a lot in Blender and Maya but those works will never see the light of day for as long as I live.</p>
<p>Anyways, enjoy the spinning medic crate that isn't in the game.</p>
