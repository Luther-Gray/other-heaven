  <p class="subtitle"><strong>2025-04-13</strong></p>

  <p>Next in line for my gaggle of destroyed and scrapped projects is Voxterra. Back when Cube World was basically nuked from orbit thanks to a horrible launch with more than questionable Game Design, I wanted to tinker around with the concept. I set up my player to have swappable pieces, once again making the folly of doing too much character art before making the actual fucking game~ :]</p>

<p>Voxterra's scope was very small, but I was already juggling far too many plates, in addition to learning Javascript so I could cleanly exit the gaming industry at the time and land on a soft cushion.</p>
<p>In the end, it died before it could even walk. I still have the GDD for it laying around somewhere but it wasn't detailed at all.</p>
<p>At one point I wanted to make a mod for Veloren to swap the player with this kind of Cube World-like character model instead of the defaults (I didn't like them very much) but Veloren was written in RUST! HAHAHAHHAAHAHA! WHY? I DON'T KNOW! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!</p>
