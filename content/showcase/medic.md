I play a lot of Minecraft, especially modded. I've always wanted to make my own pack on the Fabric modloader, but I didn't have all the mods I needed to make it happen.

After months of oo-ing and aa-ing over the right version for me, I settled on 1.21 and went to work on my very first mod.

Java was hell and Gradle should burn in a pit far away from mortal eyes.

I've made a few mods since then, Tools of the Apoc and something else I have cooking up that I'm bug fixing now, but Roblox Development has distracted me a lot lol.

Also the icon for Medic! was my first time speed sculpting in Blockbench. I did it a lot in Blender and Maya but those works will never see the light of day for as long as I live.

Anyways, enjoy the spinning medic crate that isn't in the game.
