*Hip-Hop Culture Heavy Post Ahead*

# AHHHHHHHHHH WHAT IS HE DOING?!

There's a tradition you go through when Kanye West is your goat. Every other year, the entire hip-hop community gets to point and laugh at you as the world watches your goat crash the fuck out. It's a humiliation ritual, a universal hazing that surpasses the absolute devastation that is Carti fans waiting 5 years for yet ANOTHER mid album, Drake fans sweating their asses off trying to defend this guy from xyz allegation/Karen-ass move, and Cole fans swearing up and down that their goat was just playin around with that grippy bar.

I wake up in a cold sweat every morning, whisper a "he made Graduation" prayer to no one in particular, check my phone and then collapse into a pile of fucking ash, like a vampire exposed to sunlight. I'm not showing these tweets because I already get laughed at enough by people **in** the hip-hop community.

I DON'T NEED MORE PEOPLE TO POINT AND LAUGH!

# Just change your G.O.A.T lol

YOU DON'T THINK I'VE TRIED?! No one has that catalogue like Kanye does man! Kendrick crawls out of the shadows for a full album every half decade. JID only has 3 full albums, everything else is a feature (he slaps but it's just the one feature!). Tyler is crazy fantastic, but also crazy experimental. A$AP Rocky basically retired after he snatched up Rihanna. Frank Ocean wants all his fans to FUCKING DIE. Earl- Oh god.

Basically what I'm saying is that Kenny Mason is my last hope and if that doesn't work out I'm just gonna fucking [REDACTED].

Why can't Kanye just chill tf out man?! What's up with this guy?! We were all in a better place when he was banned on Twitter I swear! NEVER should've let this guy back into the gates!

I just need one more. One more good record then I can wash my hands of this mf for GOOD. Donda wasn't closure. Just one more time I need this guy to get his shit together and prove that he was trolling ever since *Jesus Is King*. You don't know what it's like to be a stan of a crazy bastard like this one! I'm trapped in hell! HE MADE GRAADUATION, COME ON MAN!

# "Luther I want to tell you MY favorite artist now!"

You know I thought about adding a guestbook/comment section just recently, but now I'm sitting here rubbing my chin like- "Naahhhhh, that's not a good fucking idea buddy!" Some nasty rat will skitter in, sniffling-"Have you listened to that new PartyNextDoor?" "Hey man, what about Future, I saw DS2 on your scroll bro. Come on bro. Can't trust these hoooooeeees bro."

You and I, we're cordial. Y'know? Author and reader. We have a harmonious relationship that transcends time and space. You wouldn't want to throw that away just to tell me, "Actually, I thought Whole Lotta Mid was great! And that new thang? I Am Music? *chef kiss*"

Let's get along to get along. You have the worst taste imaginable, and I have to crawl on my hands and knees, nose to the fucking ground, begging and pleading like a worthless slug drowning in salt, "Kanye does not speak for black people please don't listen to this guy!"

We're similar in that way, aren't we? Yeah, I agree. **WE** are in the same boat.

We used to have good times. Before he said he wanted to buy a tank and started parading his 4th wife around naked on broadway. That documentary came out and had everyone on his side for a bit and dissing the hell out of Jay-Z. I could go to sleep smiling. I could talk about my musical tastes while I was on a date and get a smile of respect. Sure I didn't like JPEG Mafia, but Kanye was a reasonable pick! A classic!

Everytime I started to feel down, I looked at Drake fans watching their mans destroy the culture in real time and nodded my head in satisfaction. "Good." I'd say to myself, chuckling because while their goat made one hit, Scorpion, he was never consistent. I could end every single argument with "Dog, your goat is Drake. Sit the fuck down lol"

But then Kanye tweets, I get pinged, and-

"Shocking New Development! Local Black Man Found In A Catatonic State After Kanye West Defends Hitler, AGAIN!"

I can't win! JUST GIVE ME ONE MORE! ONE MORE GOOD RECORD! I KNOW YOU CAN! QUIT PLAYIN! I FEEL LIKE A GAMBLER WITH A HOLE IN HIS POCKET! I CAN'T LOSE AGAIN CAN I?! SURELY I CAN GET A FUCKING WIN! GIMMIE A WIN! MAKE THE PAIN STOP! BAN THIS ASSHOLE FROM TWITTER! TAKE AWAY THE NITROUS! WHO IS HIS HANDLER?! SOMEONE GET HIM! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA FUCK!

Horrific vibes~ | Luther
