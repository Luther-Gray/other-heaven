# Happy Fall! üëãüèø

MY FAVORITE SEASON! AND WHAT BETTER WAY TO SPEND MY TIME THAN TO **REFACTOR MY ENTIRE FUCKING WEBSITE**!! :D

Ok look, I hate social media. I don't have any. Even that Misskey account I have is basically unused. I don't enjoy talking about my life in short bursts. I don't take pictures of yet another absolutly crazy pork roast that I made. I'm a simple man with unhinged ideas and one of my favorite things to do is yap like no one else can hear me! And so I was like, huh, why don't I start a blog? It can be just like the good ole' days of Web 2!

I found a god damned webring, NeoSSG, and said "that's what I wanna be apart of!". Bad choice Luther! You IDIOT! HAHAHAHA!

I picked Zola because I was still in my "Rust is going to be the future and I should learn it" phase and not in my "I just need this shit to work bro" era. Either way, the more I looked at SSGs, the more I recognized that it's right up my alley. I don't need auth, I don't need accounts, I don't use any crazy content or features. State? What the hell do I need to manage state for? I'm posting a bunch of words.

Normally, you can do that with some HTML, right? But it's SO FUN to write in markdown bro. I can't get enough of this!

No messy tags, no cramped writing enviroment, emoji, headers, bold, I'm free-flowing! And in that way, making this site as an SSG was 100% worth it.

However-

# Dun-Dun-Duuuun!

On more than one occasion, I basically face-plant into a brick wall called "No Javascript".

I've used so many different HACKS to get different things on this site to work the way I want and now it's come back to bite me, mainly in the form of overlapping styles.

I do this shit for a job. I knew the importance of consistent styling and style scope. And yet, here I am, using a flex box that is the wrong size and doesn't scale properly in its container.

I gotta fix that.

But if I fix that, then I have to basically remake EVERY SCSS class. I have comments and it STILL is a mess. And that's just a part of the problem, right?

Certain parts of this site just don't work well on mobile or smaller screens. It's not responsive because my @media queries aren't there. Then those HACK features I put together, like image carosels that are literally repeating div image chains...

Bro, this is NOT doable.

I love markdown, I love being able to basically just make a md file and rant like a loon while yet another blog post is added to my list.

But I have to admit it. I want Javascript. I MISS Javascript! I can't believe I said it out loud.

# Scandelous!

I feel like I've let some god of purity down! Raw HTML and CSS! That was the plan! Neat, tidy, small! And what's happened to me is what happens to everyone who tries minimalism. It's amazing just how much of a mess you make when you don't have a lot of shit in the first place!

I keep thinking over my technical requirements, and why I even need an SSG. Why didn't I just use raw HTML files???? Why did I need a framework???? Can't I just, parse this stuff myself? Even my last.fm recently played is only looking like that because I can't use my own Javascript! It's a mess! I'm a MESS!

And damn dude I want a fresh coat of paint. A complete refactor that aligns closer with my original vision. Or maybe I'll make a new one.

I don't know.

But this site, as it is now, I'm starting an active renovation!

Also, webrings and this entire Web 2 fad is bunk. I'm just gonna do full indie, Web 2 movement or not.  I love the blinkies tho. I have to design something that lets me keep them. They are VERY fun.
